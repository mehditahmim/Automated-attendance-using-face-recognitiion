# project_attendance
This project was developed for my senior design course. It is an android application by which teachers can take attendance
of a classroom with the help of face recognitiion. The teacher needs to take a photo of the class and submit it to the system to  get the attendance 
counted. To run the project you need to download the files and open the file using android studio and also you need to keep the django server running 
and then run the project in android studio.
